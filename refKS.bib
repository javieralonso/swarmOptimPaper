	Abstract = {In this paper we consider a class of dynamic vehicle routing problems, in which a number of mobile agents in the plane must visit target points generated over time by a stochastic process. It is desired to design motion coordination strategies in order to minimize the expected time between the appearance of a target point and the time it is visited by one of the agents. We propose control strategies that, while making minimal or no assumptions on communications between agents, provide the same level of steady-state performance achieved by the best known decentralized strategies. In other words, we demonstrate that inter-agent communication does not improve the efficiency of 
such systems, but merely affects the rate of convergence to the steady state. Furthermore, the proposed strategies do not rely on the knowledge of the details of the underlying stochastic process. Finally, we show that our proposed strategies provide an efficient, pure Nash equilibrium in a game theoretic formulation of the problem, in which each agent's objective is to maximize the number of targets it visits. Simulation results are presented and discussed.

	Abstract = { In this paper we design coordination policies for a heterogeneous
  team, composed of autonomous vehicles and remotely located human
  operators, for a routing problem requiring human-assisted
  classification of targets through analysis of information gathered
  on site by autonomous vehicles.  More precisely, we consider the
  following problem. Targets are generated according to a
  spatio-temporal Poisson process, uniformly in a region of
  interest. It is desired to classify targets as friends
  or foes. In order to enable human operators to classify a
  target, one of the vehicles needs to travel to the target's location
  and gather sufficient information. In other words, the autonomous
  vehicles provide access to on-site information, and the human
  operator provide the judgment capabilities necessary to process such
  information.  The objective of our analysis is to design joint
  motion coordination and operator scheduling policies that minimize
  the expected time needed to classify a target after its appearance;
  in addition, we want to analyze how the achievable system
  performance depends on the number of autonomous vehicles and of
  human operators.  We present novel policies for joint motion
  coordination and human operator scheduling and compare the
  performance of these policies with respect to asymptotic performance
  bounds. Simulation results are presented and discussed.},
