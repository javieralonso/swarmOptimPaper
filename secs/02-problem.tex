\section{Problem definition}\label{sec:2}

\subsection{Multi-robot motion planning}
Motion planning is concerned with computing a (lowest cost) path or trajectory between two configurations embedded in a cost field, while taking into account motion constraints, static obstacles, and dynamic objects.  \citet{lavalle06} provides a very good introductory textbook to the field of motion planning, complemented with the recent review on remaining challenges~\citep{LaValle:2011wc}. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is typically divided in two steps, global motion planning that computes a trajectory from the initial to the goal configuration and local motion planning (or collision avoidance) which computes at a higher frequency a feasible trajectory for a short period of time.
