\subsection{Task assignment}

\textbf{Goal assignment}.
Good overview with taxonomy and link to optimization~\cite{Gerkey:2004il}. For ST-SR (single robot per task and single task per robot) optimal~\cite{kuhn55} or suboptimal auction algorithm~\cite{Bertsekas:1992wx}.
Combined with motion planning towards concurrent planning and assignment~\cite{Turpin:2014bu} and with local collision avoidance and optimal coverage towards pattern formation with large teams of robots~\cite{alonsomora12ijrr}.

\textbf{Dynamic vehicle routing} \cite{Bullo.Frazzoli.ea:PIEEE10}

\subsection{Surveillance and monitoring tasks}


\textbf{Miscellaneous}. 
Iterative optimization for optimal coverage~\cite{cortes04} and~\cite{Schwager:2009fz}. Rebalancing and mobility-on-demand formulated as linear programs~\cite{Smith:2013fa}.

\textbf{Rendezvous/ Flocking/ Consensus} The basic idea is the alignment of states (position, heading angle, memory state). Key references are \cite{Cortes.Martinez.ea:06,Jadbabaie.Lin.ea:03}.
