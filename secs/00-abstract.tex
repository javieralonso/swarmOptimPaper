% Abstract
%This paper is a short tutorial on optimal control and optimization methods for multi-robotic  systems. 
In this short tutorial, we provide a general overview of the control and optimization methods underlying four major classes of multi-robotic applications, namely \emph{motion planning}, \emph{formation planning}, \emph{task assignment} and \emph{surveillance and monitoring}. We provide mathematical descriptions of canonical problems in these application domains and discuss key results in the literature that use optimal control and optimization techniques to solve various variants of the canonical problems.  

% and introduce the basic tools on optimal control and constrained optimization. This is followed by a short literature review with different approaches to solve the presented problems using the described optimization tools.
