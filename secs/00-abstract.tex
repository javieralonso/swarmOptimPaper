% Abstract
In this paper we present a short tutorial and literature review on Optimal Control and Optimization Methods for Multi-Robot Systems. In particular, we describe four multi-robot problems, namely \emph{motion planning}, \emph{formation planning}, \emph{task assignment} and \emph{surveillance and monitoring} and introduce the basic tools on optimal control and constrained optimization. This is followed by a short literature review with different approaches to solve the presented problems using the described optimization tools.
