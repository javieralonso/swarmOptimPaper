\section{Introduction}\label{sec:1}
The field of multi-robotic systems has attracted a lot of attention from the research community in the last several years. A significant portion of this research activity leverages advancements in optimal control and optimization techniques to provide formal performance guarantees for several multi-robotic problems. The availability of software libraries for these tools, combined with increasing computational capacity of robotic platforms provides a further impetus to bring advancements in optimal control and optimization techniques to the domain of multi-robotic systems. 

% we have observed a large increase in the number of multi-robot applications, with a large body of work by the community. In this short tutorial we look specifically at solutions involving optimal control and optimization methods. 

The objective of this paper is to present an overview of optimal control and optimization tools within the context of four major classes of multi-robotic applications, namely \emph{motion planning}, \emph{formation planning}, \emph{task assignment} and \emph{surveillance and monitoring}. We provide mathematical descriptions of canonical problems in these application domains and discuss key results in the literature that use optimal control and optimization techniques to solve various variants of the canonical problems.  

%The attractiveness of optimization methods steams in that they provide guarantees in the optimality of the solution and, thanks to recent advances in the field of constrained optimization and an increase in computational power of robotic platforms, they are now applicable to efficiently solve a wide range of problems.

%In this paper we present a short tutorial and literature review on Optimal Control and Optimization Methods for Multi-Robot Systems. 

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:2} we describe four multi-robot problems, namely \emph{motion planning}, \emph{formation planning}, \emph{task assignment} and \emph{surveillance and monitoring}. In Section~\ref{sec:3} we introduce the basic tools on optimal control and constrained optimization. This is followed by a literature review of representative methods in Section~\ref{sec:4}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:5} concludes this paper.
