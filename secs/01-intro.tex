\section{Introduction}\label{sec:1}

In the last years we have observed a large increase in the number of multi-robot applications, with a large body of work by the community. In this short tutorial we look specifically at solutions involving optimal control and optimization methods. 

The attractiveness of optimization methods steams in that they provide guarantees in the optimality of the solution and, thanks to recent advances in the field of constrained optimization and an increase in computational power of robotic platforms, they are now applicable to efficiently solve a wide range of problems.

In this paper we present a short tutorial and literature review on Optimal Control and Optimization Methods for Multi-Robot Systems. The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~\ref{sec:2} we describe four multi-robot problems, namely \emph{motion planning}, \emph{formation planning}, \emph{task assignment} and \emph{surveillance and monitoring}. In Section~\ref{sec:3} we introduce the basic tools on optimal control and constrained optimization. This is followed by a literature review of representative methods in Section~\ref{sec:4}. Finally, Section~\ref{sec:5} concludes this paper.
