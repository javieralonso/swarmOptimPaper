\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:5}
Optimal control and optimization techniques play a dominant role in the design and operation of multi-robotic systems. In this paper, we provided an overview of these techniques in the context of four major classes of multi-robotic problems. 

%A large body of work exists in Optimal Control and Optimization Methods for Multi-Robot Systems. 
%We have described four problems, a set of tools and presented representative works from the community.
%The attractiveness of this methods typically stem from the optimality guarantees of their solutions, either globally or locally and their computational efficiency when formulated as convex optimizations.
