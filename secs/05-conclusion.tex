\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:5}

A large body of work exists in Optimal Control and Optimization Methods for Multi-Robot Systems. 
We have described four problems, a set of tools and presented representative works from the community.
The attractiveness of this methods typically steam from the optimality guarantees of their solutions, either globally or locally and their computational efficiency when formulated as convex optimizations.

\textbf{DO WE NEED TO ADD DISCUSSION AND FUTURE AVENUES OF RESEARCH?}
