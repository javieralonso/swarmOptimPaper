Introduce optimization types and seminal/book references

\subsection{Optimal control and dynamic programming}

\subsubsection{Optimal Control}
Consider a controlled dynamical system: $\dot{x}=f(x,u)$, $x(0)=x^0$. Then optimal control corresponds to finding a control $u^*$ which maximizes the payoff functional
$$
P[u(.)]:=\int_0^T r\left(x(t), u(t) \right) dt + g(x(T)),
$$
where $r(.,.)$ is the running payoff, $g(.)$ the terminal payoff, and $T>0$ is the terminal time. 

\subsubsection{Model Predictive Control}
the optimal control inputs are obtained by solving an optimization problem with an approximated model of the system for a fixed time horizon and applying the first input, see~\citet{Maciejowski:2002wc, Camacho:2004tg, Borrelli:2011uw} for details.

\subsection{Constrained optimization}

The goal of an optimization problem is to compute the values of a set of variables $\x \in \X$ which minimize an objective function subject to a set of inequality and equality constraints.
\e
\begin{array}{rlll}
\x^* := & \arg \underset{\x}{\min} & f(\x) 		& \\
 	& \tn{subject to} 		& g_i(\x) \leq 0 	& \forall i \in \{1,\dots, n_{ineq} \} \\
  	&	  		  		& h_i(\x) = 0 	& \forall i \in \{1,\dots, n_{eq} \}
 \end{array}
\ee

Optimization problems are classified depending on the type of variables and constraints. We name some of the most common ones. For further reading, \citet{Nocedal:2006uv} provides a good overview on numerical optimization, \citet{Bertsekas:1999ua} in non-linear programming and \citet{Boyd:2004uz} in convex optimization. A large number of state of the art solvers exist, popular ones include OOQP, CPLEX, GUROBI, MOSEK and CVXGEN.

\subsubsection{Convex optimization with continuous variables $\x \in \R$}
This family of problems can be solved extremely efficiently.
These can be further classified into \emph{Linear programming LP} if the cost and constraints are linear,
\emph{Quadratic programming QP} if the cost and constraints are quadratic and convex and \emph{Semi-Definite Programming SDP} if a linear objective function is minimized over the intersection of the cone of positive semidefinite matrices with an affine space.

\subsubsection{Non-convex optimization with continuous variables}
General non-linear problems, where $\x \in \R$, that can not be formulated as a QP or SDP can be solved via \emph{Gradient-based Methods} or \emph{Sequential Convex Programming SCP} where a local solution is found by iteratively linearizing the problem. A global solution can be found via heuristic or probabilistic \emph{search techniques}.  

\subsubsection{Optimization with integer variables}
Consider the case where some of the variables $\x_j$ take integer, $\x_j \in \N$, or typically binary, $\x_j \in \{0,1\}$, values.
%For integer programs with only binary variables, a solution can be found via explicit enumeration.
This defines a \emph{Mixed Integer Progam MIP}, namely MILP or MIQP depending on if the cost and constraints are linear or quadratic. This problem is inherently non convex and can be solved via branch-and-bound with search heuristics, where several LPs/QPs are solved for changing values of the binary variables.
